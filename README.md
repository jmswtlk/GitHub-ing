# GitHub-ing
Ins and outs of software, presumed owner of life 

Our first repository dealt with our application area. Some focus there was getting familiar with this cloud'd marvel. So, that was two days ago. 'Enuf. We'll switch the motive concerns to here and get that back on track. 

Trying to build a blog in this repository. Ought I use a folder to keep it separate? ... Yes, using blog. So, it'll be GitHub-ing/blog/ in order to keep this away from stuff being done under GitHub-ing.

After going through some of the steps, I'm reminded of earlier work related to Joomla, Concrete 5, Wordpress, and a few others. So, I just now went back to see. Actually in 2014, started a technology blog with Wordpress. 1) The original notice to pay up or move: https://thomasgardnerofsalem.blogspot.com/2012/03/thomasgardnersocietyorg.html (this March 2012). After poking around and looking at various hosts and their packages, I went with a kludge: http://thomasgardnersociety.org/older/default_back1.html Those buttons are images cut from the .NET page (ongoing Discussion is at http://tgsoc.org/demo/demo.html). Oh yes, everywhere, SQL being misused; highly flexible pages; I wanted structure so that I could handle centuries using the same framework - doing the work - not trying to hack pretty improvements. 2) Year later. After I got converted and did other content work (as well as heavy research), I started to look at alternatives (https://thomasgardnerofsalem.blogspot.com/2013/07/website-and-cms.html). All of these required digging deeper than I wanted at the time. That was when I played with codecademy enough to refresh myself on CSS (http://thomasgardnersociety.org/older/default_back2.html). Mainly, mouse action plus a footer and some layout. 3) More work (papers, applications to Heritage Societies), then Google said, you had to be mobile friendly. Back to the drawing board. http://thomasgardnersociety.org/default_back5.html 4) Finally, some reorg seen as needed. Several publications. Lots more stacking up. The 400th celebrations coming up. We're transitioning for the next century. Besides, several examples of minimal approach came up. This is opposed to those huge bucket of seeming crap that get thrown down. Don't use mobile, but how do they weed through that stuff. No wonder all of the paging and scrolling. http://tgsoc.org/default.html 5) Also, we Incorporated and got IRS approval as a non-profit. So, what busyness stuff to do? Whatever it is, we'll have web presence and support. Hence, this work.
