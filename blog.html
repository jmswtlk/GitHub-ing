          11/16/2019 -- With the cloud, where does one find an anchor? Content-wise, there are several natural analogs that relate to how people have coped for thousands of years; actually, we can look at these and their evolution to think about computation. It's called truth engineering (more later). And, in that context of review, we have the individual and the collective, of which system are not a bad abstraction to invoke. One problem is finding good domains with which to look at the issues. Science is too hard. People stuff is too soft. Is there a middle? Yes, we have it. <br><br>
          11/14/2019 -- Motivations? Lots of these. Any good deal involves a few different ones. We can itemize and discuss. Probably will, at some point. Ever since technology arose, we have not had the balance twixt content and configuration. So, why now? Let's start there. <br><br> 
          11/10/2019 -- Somehow, got involved above the floor. So, didn't get to this medium. Floor? Again, context versus configuration. A spiral that has no beginning nor end.           <br><br>
          11/06/2019 -- Thinking of content/configuration as related, we need to see where is that spiral. Well, one major focus is cultural heritage. This is human in origin. Science is such, very much cultural. It has its heirarchies with the 'hard' stuff being respected; that is, matter is that matters. Those things related to humans are ignored. Well, we'll turn that around. ... As well as being of culture, we have hereditary aspects, too. The generations flow, one after another. ... But, in all of this, where does one go in the modern technological era to know what's what? We will never see an all-knowing robot. That is something to discuss. ... On the other hand, we can study people and their ways, especially when we have a good basis. From where I sit, the 400-year view has lots of potential for this. ... In the meantime, it's a matter of doing things, making choices, hopefully, keeping them in sync with the overall thrust. On the other hand, what are a few side-tracks if we learn? And, serendipity? It'll play. <br><br>
          
          10/23/2019 -- A few new requirements came up this week after some above-the-floor activity. Throwing those to the technical side (below the floor) is always more involved than we like to think. The former is content, in this case. Never ending bit of stuff since closure is, for the most part, situational. We decide what we like to do; there is always a time lag between thought and realization. That gap will become more problematic with auto methods perturbing things.  <br><br>
          10/14/2019 -- With regard to truth engineering, we can talk rings and rings: <a href="https://cacm.acm.org/magazines/2019/10/239673-open-source-firmware/fulltext">Open Source Firmware</a>. Think rings, one inside the other. Analogous to the above and below a floor. But, the rings make spiral a little more graspable. That is, we have content and configuration, related, in a spiralling sense.<br><br>
          10/08/2019 -- Will be explaining psychether as it pertain to human-machine dynamics. Too, we will have to look
          at life and more.<br><br>
          10/06/2019 -- The <a href="https://cacm.acm.org/">Communications of the ACM</a>
is a gem of pertinent articles, of a variety of interests and
details, about computing themes. There is a section for technical
reports about research. Some articles are based upon the method of a
conversation/interview. Every month, some articles are open to
public read, otherwise, the abstract is available. Fortunately, we
find this 'interview' article as open: <a
href="https://cacm.acm.org/magazines/2019/9/238966-daml/fulltext">DAML:
The Contract Language of Distributed Ledgers</a>. The context
deals with the use of abstraction in attempts to handle a huge aspect of
information processing, namely transactions. This is one area where the use of old and true ways
          is the reality. Well, these methods have been proven through time and use. But the state of
          those old systems prevents gaining benefit from modern ways.  We can take a
further look at the post-web state of affairs with regard to transactions as a
focus and discuss the history. In fact, our truth portal uses older ways and means, by choice. We're looking to improve. 
          One concept, of note, deals with 'mutualization' (say, of the infrastructure) and
its influence. That people build general methods (frameworks, services, et al) which are
          adopted and shared has been seen. However, we can see messes arise, too. Some of this
          is due to early jumping on bandwagons where failure is, then, felt by many. Rushing forward and breaking
          things has consequences that are negative as well as beneficial. Where did the idea of disruption as only good
          come from? Well, we'll continue to discuss those issues. It is nice to see that
          our current state of looking around to decide our
next steps deals with general topics that are still open. And, we're in no hurry. 
          <br><br>
          10/01/2019 -- Have to add this in. Bayes' thoughts have been applied now for over a decade including AI. We really need to look at the guy and his time. <a href="http://biostat.jhsph.edu/courses/bio621/misc/bayesbiog.pdf">The Reverend Thomas Bayes, FRS:</a> A Biography to Celebrate the Tercentenary of His Birth. Given at a statistical meeting in 2001, the 300th of his birth. The article is followed by Comments from illustrious members of the statistical world.

          <br><br>09/29/2019 -- This article, <a href="https://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2019-09/ucl-nlh092019.php">Numbers limit how accurately digital computers model chaos</a>, resulted in a bit of Quora discussion. One needs to take it back to the original paper: <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/adts.201900125">A New Pathology in the Simulation of Chaotic Dynamical Systems on Digital Computers<a>. Wiley lets one read the article. <br><br>
          09/24/2019 -- A couple papers: <a href="https://cacm.acm.org/magazines/2019/9/238965-bitwise/abstract">Bitwise: A Life in Code</a> (video, too); <a href="https://cacm.acm.org/magazines/2019/9/238959-an-inability-to-reproduce/fulltext">An Inability to Reproduce</a>.     <br><br>
          09/22/2019 -- Today, in 1692, several persons were hung in Salem, MA. More later. ... Meanwhile, we're splitting out the blog from the commentary. <br><br>  
            09/21/2019 -- Got reminded, today, of a paradox that is apropos: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moravec's_paradox">Moravec's paradox</a>. TGS, Inc. uses the domains associated with people and their lives as the framework for evaluating AI and other advanced methods.  <br><br>
          09/20/2019 -- Finally, digging into <a href="https://openai.com/about/">OpenAI</a>. Have read of it, seen references, and such. Now, looking into it with my own eyes. AI --> AGI, thereabout. More later. ... Forgot, this is Musk's deal. Time to do a scan of the different views. OpenAI uses 'human will' which is a nice thought. I'll write more elsewhere. ... Oh yes, OpenAI's thing writes so well that they don't want to release it. Still, William Blake. Keep that in mind. ... Final thought, tonight: <a href="https://craft.co/openai/competitors">other views</a>. Nice demo of what the Internet brings. Also, OpenAI said that they would be more cooperative than competitive. I just used it as a search term. <br><br>  
         09/18/2019 -- <a href="https://thomasgardnerofsalem.blogspot.com/2019/09/new-infrastructure.html">New infrastructure</a>. Too much fun.<br><br> 
          09/15/2019 -- Saw that there had been discussion about a 'version manifest' and its use, such as for showing what is in a binary (executable). Truth engineeing is the context. That techniques deals with judging software in its various modes. Then, we need to deal with general knowledge, people, and a huge gamut of stuff. ... Post this post, got email notice of a build failure. First one. Didn't do anything different, so environment (wherever) or spook or ... Okay, worked. Only difference is that I lazily took the default comment on the change. Now, I know about possible errors and debugging. <br><br>
          09/12/2019 -- Would be interesting to see what 'AI' is being done by GitHub within the domain of it responsibility. <br><br>
          09/07/2019 -- Need to put in a reference to what got me, finally, to GitHub. It was reading this (<a href="http://aima.cs.berkeley.edu/">Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach</a>), again, and seeing the particulars with respect to <a href="http://aimacode.github.io/aima-javascript/">aima-javascript</a> which uses a blog nestled at GitHub. That was one month ago. I got lost in running around GitHub. The focus is (will be) this: ML/DL is not AL which is the larger domain. The brain is not the key thing; your gut is more involved with your survival. ... So we need to see how older AI fits in (lots of ways) plus there is the demonstration of little javascript in action (<a href="https://github.com/aimacode">aimacode</a>). Their code was at <a href="http://aima.cs.berkeley.edu/code.html">aima.cs.berkeley.edu/code.html</a>. -- incidently, still hacking HTML, looking for a good editor<br><br>
          
          09/02/2019 -- The future? Here is a nice thought (<a href="https://www.quora.com/Will-Git-ever-be-replaced/answer/Ben-Podgursky">Will Git ever be replaced?</a>). Data and code were split for various reasons, however, as many themes have shown, these two are inextrictably woven. I have written, too: code is a mere side-effect of logic. It is that code and data represent jointly; it is that which is 'represented' that we are sorely ignoring. 
          <br><br>
          08/29/2019 -- Watched the video, today, announcing Actions (<a href="https://live-stream.github.com/">Live Events</a>). Will be commenting on several of the things discussed, eventually, but, initially, my great joy in running into GitHub (or, rather, opening the door to the experience) was seeing all of these capabilities integrated and accessible. Granted, there are private repositories which I will have, to boot. But, the openness plus the file format carrying forward just sits well with what I have been doing (or thought that we should do) for decades. Too, the whole framework reinforces my thoughts that JS has more to it than was recognized by those doing 'real' code. This work demonstrates the future, in many ways. Also, want to know? I immediately see how to use this experience to talk truth engineering and to discuss underlying issues that go way beyond what computationally oriented minds like to consider. ... later ... run these on your own hardware (or VM or ...) for free (31:04)? now you're talking ... it just keeps getting better. I, definitely, will be taking this discussion to Quora. Example: <a href="https://www.quora.com/Is-JS-useful-in-artificial-intelligence">Is JS useful in artificial intelligence?</a>.  
          <br><br>
          08/28/2019 -- Earlier, I signed up for testing the workflow manager being developed by GitHub (<a href="https://github.com/features/actions">GitHub Actions</a>) and got notice of access, today. After a quick look, we will be getting to this in the next couple of days. So far, and it has been a couple of weeks, GitHub has been great. Having the 'open' option for poking around (and, perhaps, contributing) cannot be over emphasized. Software, as a part of life, does reign large. Needs hardware, though. Too, interpretion belongs to us, the mere humans.<br><br>
            
            
          08/23/2019 -- Lots of distraction, for the coming week or so. Have to get the summer ended with proper enthusiasm. So, may be quiet for a bit.

          08/20/2019 -- I am using hidden variables for parameters. Will switch 
          the template. However, the other day, on getting a file from the existing
          site and doing a modification, the menu handler didn't work on GitHub's pages. 
          So, I hacked the code; on second thought, remembered the parameters. 
          So, just changed that. Difference? Commenting out and changing a couple lines 
          of code versus ... one parameter value. BTW, tackling understanding of DL
          will be grasping with parameters. We forgot the long trek from wires to
          abstract'd methods. All we have to do is recover that process.  <br>
          <br>
          08/17/2019 -- Have been reading discussions about JS and AI.
          Some see it as a travesty. Myself, if we can build a common
          platform for people to experience AI's effects, that is a step
          forward. Not unlike, from what I have seen so far, the motives
          talked about long ago with the Lisp Machine, albeit we were
          way too early with regard to communications and other
          technology. ... In this regard, I am working on getting the
          code organized, GitHub'd, plus get some of the auxilliary
          capability used, especially those things related to project
          management and collaboration. <br>
          <br>
          08/16/2019 -- Looked at JS; yes, it's been extended to be
          general, including supporting mobile devices. Some wags say,
          mimicking browsers. Whatever. Looked at the code management
          situations; several other alternatives, however some of these
          actually just extend GitHub. ... Truth engineering is it,
          folks. Not hacking code. That is not the essence. Time we
          learn what differentiates us from whatever AI comes about.
          Okay? ... During this period, I'll get a process started after
          thoroughly reviewing all of the ins and outs of the important
          issues and packages offered, including psyching out
          motivations. Yes, we're non-profit; with, I might add, a new
          interpretation (about time?). <br>
