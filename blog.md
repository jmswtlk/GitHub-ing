12/03/2019 -- 1/2 way through the recent The Atlantic. They've improved content as well as restructured their look. A balanced look at red/blue which applies to computing. Has to do with 'floor' (and walls). They quote the PhD Cambridge (from Idaho - who wrote of her hayseed folks). Yes, this: the difference is those who sit in the back with Uber and those who drive. I have not Uber'd. Don't really intend to. One old progressive mind, on being cajoled by his daughter to Uber (verb) and having talked to the driver, said to me: that is no life with future expectations. Of course he knows holding a full pension plus the accumulation allowed by pre-tax investment over the decades. Yes, indeed. All of those magic carpet riders (riding with their diapers as mom/pop carried them along to somewhere else than where they were) need to relook at themselves. 

11/30/2019 -- The 400th ought to help get a necessity started. Namely, northern New England's importance in establishing what became the U.S. And, we are talking fifteen generations or so, even more when southern New England is brought in the equation.  

11/23/2019 -- Time runs away from us. Trying to control by overloading, or even overlording, does not work. However, one method which has seriously been overlooked is handling cross-temporal matters. Saw interest in https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_crystal as something to look at in this regard. 

11/20/2019 -- Well, it's here. GitHub can be used to represent the floor/core in the context of the spiral of content and configuration in the various spaces with which we are familiar. Needless to say, there are many more spaces; and, I am not referring to those of the abstracted realm behind the doings of data science (machine learning, et al). That is of the configuration side, presenting interesting views to below-the-floor stuff. No way does it capture the essence, as we need to do. ... Now, floor/core? I have a lot about this on Quora and will be coordinating (with myself) on getting this stuff more organized. Briefly, I need to introduce 'psychether' and how it pertains to truth engineering which is a serious requirement being overlooked in the rush down the roads to perdition. 

11/19/2019 -- Coming soon. It'll parallel the old file. Perhaps, we'll drop text here and do the other modes in HTML/CSS/JS.
