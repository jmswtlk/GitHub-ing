12/20/2019 -- Per usual, lots of hats being worn, tasks balanced, and slowly moving toward teleological ends (yes, multiple). No days off. After all, while we're alive, the heart and lungs and more work, constantly. So, was looking at backend alternatives, not wanting to queue up with one of those huges affairs. You know, all of the social media, and other, firms offer services (which is one manifestation of API'hood which goes back to RPIs). Actually, did a couple of those a few years ago while toying with Codecademy. Well, what do I see? Jekyllrb.com. Jekyll was one of the first bits of software that I looked at, but it was in the context of having a blog supported by files. I was happy getting into GitHub for several reasons, one of which was the development focus with people working in modes outside of the restrictions of GUI. Well, I did my own little website here on GitHub using my own method and put the Jekyll stuff on standby. So, what did I see? Lots of companies using Open Source methods are using Jekyll to boot. Interesting examples. Okwy, so that then gets me to think of looking backend'ing here on GitHub, partially with Jekyll examples as a learning tool. That's on the plate where the fork is about ready to address thing for eating, so to speak. Oh yes, and templates are in the focus, too (https://jekyllrb.com/tutorials/convert-site-to-jekyll/).

12/18/2019 -- I spent a great deal of my computing years with highly-configured (high-end - Unix/RISC) workstations that were networked (geometric and numeric processes in support of design/analysis of large systems). Of course, network, early on, meant LAN, however we had T1 lines with several sites across the country (U.S.). So, the whole basis for the cloud/full-stack'ing, etc. is familiar. I was there early. In the case of the work for TGS, we're at that point, again, where I can dig in. My front-end focus (https://tgsoc.org) was due to knowing of the capability of most clients (not thin, at all). You know, thin client might be there, but, for the most part, mobile devices aren't tiny things (except for presentation). Well, yes, they can be. So, I'll continue with some front-end data handling. But, the direction is going back to the server end. Looking forward to the new focus. Of course, what do I see (well, take note of as I knew this for a while)? API access being offered everywhere. Why? Playing around? Folks, we need to discuss all of this crap. I don't see the necessary types of review being done. But, I might be missing something. We'll end up with a TGS API (preferrable, for now, to an app (we'll get there). So, I'll be blogging along while looking. Hosts have to juggle lots of players; same goes for the cloud'd variety. The server I am using doesn't like node.js (issue of tuning). I don't want to use Python (yet, lots of reasons, one of which is to see how far js can go). ... To be continued.  

12/13/2019 -- About to the point where the portal to truth's front page is mostly generated from data via JS. The point is that a minima approach has a place in the new world. Complexity for its own sake sucks. 

12/06/2019 -- Kode Vicious (George V. Neville-Neil) had a nice look at what he calls 'Koding Academies.' This was in his regular column in the ACM Communications (Dec 2019 issue). He used plumbing which I have, as well. These training sessions might help one be a front-end plumber, say going out to fix leaking pipes, etc. However, doing construction which entails planning through actually doing would require more training. So, not bad as an analogy. I liked that he mentioned html/css/java/... where '...' included a few more of the means to doing software for web sites (and their activity). The '...' list python. Interesting that he mentioned that. And, he notes that many would not include the group that he listed in computer languages. Lots to discuss there.  

12/03/2019 -- 1/2 way through the recent The Atlantic. They've improved content as well as restructured their look. A balanced look at red/blue which applies to computing. Has to do with 'floor' (and walls). They quote the PhD Cambridge (from Idaho - who wrote of her hayseed folks). Yes, this: the difference is those who sit in the back with Uber and those who drive. I have not Uber'd. Don't really intend to. One old progressive mind, on being cajoled by his daughter to Uber (verb) and having talked to the driver, said to me: that is no life with future expectations. Of course he knows holding a full pension plus the accumulation allowed by pre-tax investment over the decades. Yes, indeed. All of those magic carpet riders (riding with their diapers as mom/pop carried them along to somewhere else than where they were) need to relook at themselves. 

11/30/2019 -- The 400th ought to help get a necessity started. Namely, northern New England's importance in establishing what became the U.S. And, we are talking fifteen generations or so, even more when southern New England is brought in the equation.  

11/23/2019 -- Time runs away from us. Trying to control by overloading, or even overlording, does not work. However, one method which has seriously been overlooked is handling cross-temporal matters. Saw interest in https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_crystal as something to look at in this regard. 

11/20/2019 -- Well, it's here. GitHub can be used to represent the floor/core in the context of the spiral of content and configuration in the various spaces with which we are familiar. Needless to say, there are many more spaces; and, I am not referring to those of the abstracted realm behind the doings of data science (machine learning, et al). That is of the configuration side, presenting interesting views to below-the-floor stuff. No way does it capture the essence, as we need to do. ... Now, floor/core? I have a lot about this on Quora and will be coordinating (with myself) on getting this stuff more organized. Briefly, I need to introduce 'psychether' and how it pertains to truth engineering which is a serious requirement being overlooked in the rush down the roads to perdition. 

11/19/2019 -- Coming soon. It'll parallel the old file. Perhaps, we'll drop text here and do the other modes in HTML/CSS/JS.
