11/23/2019 -- Time runs away from us. Trying to control by overloading, or even overlording, does not work. However, one method which has seriously been overlooked is handling cross-temporal matters. Saw interest in https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_crystal as something to look at in this regard. 

11/20/2019 -- Well, it's here. GitHub can be used to represent the floor/core in the context of the spiral of content and configuration in the various spaces with which we are familiar. Needless to say, there are many more spaces; and, I am not referring to those of the abstracted realm behind the doings of data science (machine learning, et al). That is of the configuration side, presenting interesting views to below-the-floor stuff. No way does it capture the essence, as we need to do. ... Now, floor/core? I have a lot about this on Quora and will be coordinating (with myself) on getting this stuff more organized. Briefly, I need to introduce 'psychether' and how it pertains to truth engineering which is a serious requirement being overlooked in the rush down the roads to perdition.
