        <div align="left"> We'll post in this area for a while as we
          organize our thoughts about next steps and a lot more. Such
          as, meet deadlines. Such as, now the priority is getting The
          Gardner Annals, Vol. V, No. 1 into a draft form. Then,
          establish a process that is related to all content (not just
          code). We'll see. The below will be push down not unlike when
          I used Concrete 5 for our What's New for an extended period. <br>
          <br> I'm going to start a list of issues to discuss (ala Quora or similar) related to software as it is now (a product of what it was) and how it will be. Huge task? Not really. It's necessary in terms of truth engineering. <br><br>
          1. Open versus cloaked. Of course, the former is seen here on GitHub to the extent of public access; one can see all of the details. Public implies, too, repositories that can be seen by anyone. There are private ones, however those working thus are using the same tool set which is an important element to understanding. The latter? Any of those who offer services, say web presence development, through means that are opaque. I bounced off of those in 2012 (this is documented and will be part of the summary).<br>  
          2. Affectation. What? That related to computing? Has to do with expectations and their mismanagement which is a common theme. Somewhat, this issue was softened a bit throught the disruptive assumption. Yes, top-down inforcing of change for no reason other than to line the pockets of some, albeit with glowing reviews on some sides while others (many) suffer (we'll point to more than the gig economy's failings of the populace). <br>
          3. Posture always comes before the act. Somewhat, like the spark of the neuro-world.<br> 
          4. There's a reason that the old guy lags behind those rushing forward. For one thing, the maddening crowd rushes after what's hot at the moment. Some get rewarded. Guess what? Many get punished for things outside of their control and knowledge. Truth engineering has a whole new realm to poke into, now, courtesy of this article (<a href="https://cacm.acm.org/magazines/2019/9/238968-surviving-software-dependencies/fulltext">Surviving Software Dependencies</a>) by Russ Cox at Google. Case in point is the Equifax fiasco. But, there are many more. Russ makes good points about being safe. Guess what? They may use, carefully; but, they rewrite; they, as in Google. Roll-your-own. I would say, like we had this saying in the 60s, 'God grows his own' (very much an analog). Here is an example of code that is pulled that Russ uses as an example: <a href="https://github.com/sindresorhus/escape-string-regexp">sindresorhus/escape-string-regexp</a>. Russ mentions an inhibitor to doing things right, which I have written on (post at the truth engineering blog). Cost. Yes, if we did this stuff right, we wouldn't have the excess power for things like trying to show that DL is AI. We would be proving, minute to minute.<br>
          5. As an aside, <a href="https://openai.com/">OpenAI</a> has $1B, or so, in funding. That ought to keep things popping for a while. Putting off the 'inevitable' winter (would be the 3rd), except discussing that will be part of landsacpe for the next few years. For now, we can assume that interest will be there; demonstrations of wonders will be there. So, too? Truth engineering coming to the fore. And, aNN will be tamed.<br>
