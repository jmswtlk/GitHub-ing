          organize our thoughts about next steps and a lot more. Such
          as, meet deadlines. Such as, now the priority is getting The
          Gardner Annals, Vol. V, No. 1 into a draft form. Then,
          establish a process that is related to all content (not just
          code). We'll see. The below will be push down not unlike when
          I used Concrete 5 for our What's New for an extended period. <br>

          <br>
          08/17/2019 -- Have been reading discussions about JS and AI.
          Some see it as a travesty. Myself, if we can build a common
          platform for people to experience AI's effects, that is a step
          forward. Not unlike, from what I have seen so far, the motives
          talked about long ago with the Lisp Machine, albeit we were
          way too early with regard to communications and other
          technology. ... In this regard, I am working on getting the
          code organized, GitHub'd, plus get some of the auxilliary
          capability used, especially those things related to project
          management and collaboration. <br>
          <br>
          08/16/2019 -- Looked at JS; yes, it's been extended to be
          general, including supporting mobile devices. Some wags say,
          mimicking browsers. Whatever. Looked at the code management
          situations; several other alternatives, however some of these
          actually just extend GitHub. ... Truth engineering is it,
          folks. Not hacking code. That is not the essence. Time we
          learn what differentiates us from whatever AI comes about.
          Okay? ... During this period, I'll get a process started after
          thoroughly reviewing all of the ins and outs of the important
          issues and packages offered, including psyching out
          motivations. Yes, we're non-profit; with, I might add, a new
          interpretation (about time?). <br>
