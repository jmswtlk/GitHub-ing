        <div align="left"> We'll post in this area for a while as we
          organize our thoughts about next steps and a lot more. Such
          as, meet deadlines. Such as, now the priority is getting The
          Gardner Annals, Vol. V, No. 1 into a draft form. Then,
          establish a process that is related to all content (not just
          code). We'll see. The below will be push down not unlike when
          I used Concrete 5 for our What's New for an extended period. <br>
          <br> I'm going to start a list of issues to discuss (ala Quora or similar) related to software as it is now (a product of what it was) and how it will be. Huge task? Not really. It's necessary in terms of truth engineering. <br><br>
          1. Open versus cloaked. Of course, the former is seen here on GitHub to the extent of public access; one can see all of the details. Public implies, too, repositories that can be seen by anyone. There are private ones, however those working thus are using the same tool set which is an important element to understanding. The latter? Any of those who offer services, say web presence development, through means that are opaque. I bounced off of those in 2012 (this is documented and will be part of the summary).<br>  
          2. Affectation. What? That related to computing? Has to do with expectations and their mismanagement which is a common theme. Somewhat, this issue was softened a bit throught the disruptive assumption. Yes, top-down inforcing of change for no reason other than to line the pockets of some, albeit with glowing reviews on some sides while others (many) suffer (we'll point to more than the gig economy's failings of the populace). 
          3. Posture always comes before the act. Somewhat, like the spark of the neuro-world.

          09/07/2019 -- Need to put in a reference to what got me, finally, to GitHub. It was reading this, again (<a href="http://aima.cs.berkeley.edu/">Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach</a> and seeing the particulars with respect to <a href="http://aimacode.github.io/aima-javascript/">aima-javascript</a> which uses a blog nestled at GitHub. That was one month ago. I got lost in running around GitHub. The focus is this: ML/DL is not AL which is the larger domain. ... So we need to see how older AI fits in (lots of ways) plus there is the demonstration of little javascript in action (<a href="https://github.com/aimacode">aimacode</a>). Their code was at <a href="http://aima.cs.berkeley.edu/code.html">aima.cs.berkeley.edu/code.html</a>.<br><br>
          
          09/02/2019 -- The future? Here is a nice thought (<a href="https://www.quora.com/Will-Git-ever-be-replaced/answer/Ben-Podgursky">Will Git ever be replaced?</a>). Data and code were split for various reasons, however, as many themes have shown, these two are inextrictably woven. I have written, too: code is a mere side-effect of logic. It is that code and data represent jointly; it is that which is 'represented' that we are sorely ignoring. 
          <br><br>
          08/29/2019 -- Watched the video, today, announcing Actions (<a href="https://live-stream.github.com/">Live Events</a>). Will be commenting on several of the things discussed, eventually, but, initially, my great joy in running into GitHub (or, rather, opening the door to the experience) was seeing all of these capabilities integrated and accessible. Granted, there are private repositories which I will have, to boot. But, the openness plus the file format carrying forward just sits well with what I have been doing (or thought that we should do) for decades. Too, the whole framework reinforces my thoughts that JS has more to it than was recognized by those doing 'real' code. This work demonstrates the future, in many ways. Also, want to know? I immediately see how to use this experience to talk truth engineering and to discuss underlying issues that go way beyond what computationally oriented minds like to consider. ... later ... run these on your own hardware (or VM or ...) for free (31:04)? now you're talking ... it just keeps getting better. I, definitely, will be taking this discussion to Quora. Example: <a href="https://www.quora.com/Is-JS-useful-in-artificial-intelligence">Is JS useful in artificial intelligence?</a>.  
          <br><br>
          08/28/2019 -- Earlier, I signed up for testing the workflow manager being developed by GitHub (<a href="https://github.com/features/actions">GitHub Actions</a>) and got notice of access, today. After a quick look, we will be getting to this in the next couple of days. So far, and it has been a couple of weeks, GitHub has been great. Having the 'open' option for poking around (and, perhaps, contributing) cannot be over emphasized. Software, as a part of life, does reign large. Needs hardware, though. Too, interpretion belongs to us, the mere humans.<br><br>
            
            
          08/23/2019 -- Lots of distraction, for the coming week or so. Have to get the summer ended with proper enthusiasm. So, may be quiet for a bit.

          08/20/2019 -- I am using hidden variables for parameters. Will switch 
          the template. However, the other day, on getting a file from the existing
          site and doing a modification, the menu handler didn't work on GitHub's pages. 
          So, I hacked the code; on second thought, remembered the parameters. 
          So, just changed that. Difference? Commenting out and changing a couple lines 
          of code versus ... one parameter value. BTW, tackling understanding of DL
          will be grasping with parameters. We forgot the long trek from wires to
          abstract'd methods. All we have to do is recover that process.  <br>
          <br>
          08/17/2019 -- Have been reading discussions about JS and AI.
          Some see it as a travesty. Myself, if we can build a common
          platform for people to experience AI's effects, that is a step
          forward. Not unlike, from what I have seen so far, the motives
          talked about long ago with the Lisp Machine, albeit we were
          way too early with regard to communications and other
          technology. ... In this regard, I am working on getting the
          code organized, GitHub'd, plus get some of the auxilliary
          capability used, especially those things related to project
          management and collaboration. <br>
          <br>
          08/16/2019 -- Looked at JS; yes, it's been extended to be
          general, including supporting mobile devices. Some wags say,
          mimicking browsers. Whatever. Looked at the code management
          situations; several other alternatives, however some of these
          actually just extend GitHub. ... Truth engineering is it,
          folks. Not hacking code. That is not the essence. Time we
          learn what differentiates us from whatever AI comes about.
          Okay? ... During this period, I'll get a process started after
          thoroughly reviewing all of the ins and outs of the important
          issues and packages offered, including psyching out
          motivations. Yes, we're non-profit; with, I might add, a new
          interpretation (about time?). <br>
