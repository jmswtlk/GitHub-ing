        <div align="left"> We'll post in this area for a while as we
          organize our thoughts about next steps and a lot more. Such
          as, meet deadlines. Such as, now the priority is getting The
          Gardner Annals, Vol. V, No. 1 into a draft form. Then,
          establish a process that is related to all content (not just
          code). We'll see. The below will be push down not unlike when
          I used Concrete 5 for our What's New for an extended period. <br>

          08/28/2019 -- Earlier, I signed up for testing the workflow manager being developed by GitHub (<a href="https://github.com/features/actions">GitHub Actions</a>) and got notice of access. After a quick look, we will be getting to this in the next couple of days. So far, and it has been a couple of weeks, GitHub has been great. Having the 'open' option for poking around (and, perhaps, contributing) cannot be over emphasized. Software, as a part of life, does reign large. Needs hardware, though. Too, interpretion belongs to us, the mere humans.<br><br>
            
            
          08/23/2019 -- Lots of distraction, for the coming week or so. Have to get the summer ended with proper enthusiasm. So, may be quiet for a bit.

          08/20/2019 -- I am using hidden variables for parameters. Will switch 
          the template. However, the other day, on getting a file from the existing
          site and doing a modification, the menu handler didn't work on GitHub's pages. 
          So, I hacked the code; on second thought, remembered the parameters. 
          So, just changed that. Difference? Commenting out and changing a couple lines 
          of code versus ... one parameter value. BTW, tackling understanding of DL
          will be grasping with parameters. We forgot the long trek from wires to
          abstract'd methods. All we have to do is recover that process.  <br>
          <br>
          08/17/2019 -- Have been reading discussions about JS and AI.
          Some see it as a travesty. Myself, if we can build a common
          platform for people to experience AI's effects, that is a step
          forward. Not unlike, from what I have seen so far, the motives
          talked about long ago with the Lisp Machine, albeit we were
          way too early with regard to communications and other
          technology. ... In this regard, I am working on getting the
          code organized, GitHub'd, plus get some of the auxilliary
          capability used, especially those things related to project
          management and collaboration. <br>
          <br>
          08/16/2019 -- Looked at JS; yes, it's been extended to be
          general, including supporting mobile devices. Some wags say,
          mimicking browsers. Whatever. Looked at the code management
          situations; several other alternatives, however some of these
          actually just extend GitHub. ... Truth engineering is it,
          folks. Not hacking code. That is not the essence. Time we
          learn what differentiates us from whatever AI comes about.
          Okay? ... During this period, I'll get a process started after
          thoroughly reviewing all of the ins and outs of the important
          issues and packages offered, including psyching out
          motivations. Yes, we're non-profit; with, I might add, a new
          interpretation (about time?). <br>
