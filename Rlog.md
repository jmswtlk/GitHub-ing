Started down the trek of a public page on Github, yesterday. There were three sites for hints: 1) http://jmcglone.com/guides/github-pages/ (it looked reasonable; got through the steps to where I could load my index page; got a 404 - there was a note about it taking a few minutes; however, on looking at the files, the date was several years ago; is this link still pertinent?), 2) https://www.bloggingpro.com/archives/2018/04/04/42537/ (more recent, last year; points to supporting sites; mentions that you're on your own - which doesn't phase me), 3) https://guides.github.com/features/pages/ (seems a little clearer on getting the page visible; will look at that today). I guess I got pulled into looking at Jekyll. Will do that later after hacking the html manually (or using Composer). 

Again, the focus is content, primarily. That involves truth engineering. And, as I go down these paths, I'm always looking at why and other choices while making comparison to prior experience. Guess what? Truth engineering puts the human back in the loop and will be a tool to manage the computational overlord that likes to manifest itself which really is people just playing along (we need to discuss this) unconsciously for various reasons. So, now off to get a page visible, then we'll step back and summarize.
